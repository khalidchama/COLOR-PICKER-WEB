            <h2>Privacy Policy for Colorly.online</h2>
            <p>Last Updated: <span id="privacyPolicyDate"></span></p>

            <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
            <p>Welcome to Colorly.online! We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect when you use our website, why we collect it, how we use it, and your choices regarding your data. Please read it carefully.</p>

            <h3>2. Information We Collect (and How We Collect It)</h3>
            <p>While Colorly.online itself is a client-side tool that does not store your color selections or personal data directly on our servers, we do use industry-standard services that collect certain types of non-personally identifiable information to help us understand how our website is used and to improve your experience:</p>

            <h4>a. Usage Data (via Google Analytics)</h4>
            <p>We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies" (small text files placed on your device) to collect information about how visitors use our site. This information is anonymous and aggregated, meaning it cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>
            <!--<p>The data collected by Google Analytics typically includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your IP address (anonymized, meaning only a portion of your IP address is used to determine approximate location)</li>
                <li>Browser type and version</li>
                <li>Operating system</li>
                <li>Referring website (if you clicked a link to reach us)</li>
                <li>Date and time of visit</li>
                <li>Pages viewed and time spent on pages</li>
                <li>Actions taken on the site (e.g., clicks on buttons)</li>
            </ul>-->
            <p>We use this data to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements around the site, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. This helps us understand what features are popular, where users encounter difficulties, and how we can enhance Colorly.online.</p>
            <p>For more information on how Google collects and processes data, please visit Google's "How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services" page: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a></p>

            <h4>b. Server Logs (Standard Practice)</h4>
            <p>Like virtually all websites, our web server (the computer that hosts Colorly.online) automatically collects some basic, non-personal information when you visit the site. This is standard industry practice for ensuring website security, diagnosing problems, and understanding general traffic patterns. This information may include your IP address, browser type, operating system, and the date and time of your visit.</p>

            <h3>3. Cookies</h3>
            <p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and to provide information to the website owners.</p>
            <p>Colorly.online uses cookies primarily for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> Google Analytics uses cookies to distinguish users, to determine the duration of a user's session, and to track repeat visits.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.</p>

            <h3>4. Your Choices Regarding Cookies and Data</h3>
            <p>You have control over your data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Browser Settings:</strong> Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings. You can set your browser to refuse all cookies, to indicate when a cookie is being sent, or to delete cookies. However, if you disable cookies, some features of websites may not function properly.</li>
                <li><strong>Google Analytics Opt-out:</strong> If you wish to prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics, Google provides a browser add-on for this purpose, available here: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a></li>
                <li><strong>Do Not Track (DNT):</strong> Some browsers offer a "Do Not Track" feature that allows you to signal to websites that you do not want your online activities tracked. Colorly.online respects DNT signals where technically feasible, though the effectiveness of DNT is not universally implemented by all services.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Data Retention</h3>
            <p>Google Analytics retains data according to its standard data retention policies. We do not directly control this retention period. Server logs are typically retained for a limited period for operational and security purposes.</p>

            <h3>6. Data Security</h3>
            <p>While we do not directly collect sensitive personal data on Colorly.online, we are committed to maintaining the security of our website and the data handled by our third-party services. We use HTTPS (SSL encryption) to secure all data transmitted between your browser and our server.</p>

            <h3>7. International Data Transfers (GDPR/CCPA Consideration)</h3>
            <p>By using Colorly.online, you understand that your data, as collected by Google Analytics, may be transferred to and stored on servers located in countries outside of your own, including the United States, where data protection laws may differ. Google operates globally and adheres to various compliance frameworks for data transfers.</p>
            <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides you with certain rights regarding your personal data. If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) also grants you specific rights. While Colorly.online aims for minimal data collection, we encourage you to be aware of your rights concerning data collected by third-party services like Google Analytics.</p>

            <h3>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. When we do, we will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your privacy.</p>
